**PrismAudio** is the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Building upon [ThinkSound](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21448)'s pioneering CoT-based V2A framework, PrismAudio further decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial), each paired with targeted reward functions, enabling multi-dimensional RL optimization that jointly improves reasoning across all perceptual dimensions.

## 🚀 Features

- **V2A SOTA**: Achieves state-of-the-art results across all four perceptual dimensions on both VGGSound and AudioCanvas benchmarks.
- **Decomposed CoT Reasoning**: Four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, Spatial) each providing focused, interpretable reasoning for its corresponding perceptual dimension.
- **Multi-dimensional RL**: Fast-GRPO enables efficient multi-dimensional reward optimization without compromising generation quality.
- **New Benchmark**: AudioCanvas — a rigorous V2A benchmark with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples covering diverse and challenging scenarios.
- **Efficient**: 518M parameters with faster inference than prior SOTAs.

## ✨ Method Overview

PrismAudio consists of three main components:

1. **CoT-Aware Audio Foundation Model**: Built on a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enhanced with VideoPrism for video understanding and T5-Gemma for structured CoT text encoding.
2. **Decomposed Multi-Dimensional CoT Reasoning**: Four specialized CoT modules — Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial — each providing targeted reasoning for its corresponding perceptual dimension.
3. **Fast-GRPO Multi-Dimensional RL Framework**: A hybrid ODE-SDE sampling strategy that dramatically reduces training overhead while enabling multi-dimensional reward optimization across all perceptual dimensions.

## 📦 Third-Party Components (Reward Models)

Our Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework utilizes a multi-objective reward system, integrating the following specialized models as objective reward functions:

* **Stable Audio Open VAE** (by **Stability AI**): Serves as the foundational latent space for audio generation and reconstruction. Licensed under the [Stability AI Community License](./third_party/LICENSE_StabilityAI.md). **Commercial use and redistribution require prior permission from Stability AI.**
* **Semantic Reward Model (Microsoft CLAP)**: Based on [Microsoft CLAP](https://github.com/microsoft/CLAP), this model provides a semantic consistency reward by calculating the cosine similarity between generated audio embeddings and text prompt embeddings.
* **Semantic Reward Model (LAION CLAP, optional)**: Based on [LAION-AI CLAP](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP), used as an alternative or ensemble semantic scorer to reduce reward hacking during the RL process.
* **Temporal Synchronization Reward (Synchformer)**: Based on [Synchformer](https://github.com/v-iashin/Synchformer), this model provides a synchronization reward, evaluating the rhythmic and temporal alignment between generated audio and visual/textual cues.
* **Aesthetic & Quality Reward (Audiobox)**: Based on [Audiobox Aesthetics](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiobox-aesthetics) (Meta AI), providing a perceptual quality reward to guide the agent toward generating high-fidelity and "aesthetically pleasing" audio.
* **Spatial Consistency Reward (StereoCRW)**: Based on [StereoCRW](https://github.com/IFICL/stereocrw), specifically adapted for ITD (Interaural Time Difference) estimation to provide spatial rewards for binaural or stereo audio synthesis.
